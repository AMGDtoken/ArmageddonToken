# ArmageddonToken

Armageddons repository will be home to any and all programs and code that contributes to the development of Armageddon free to copy and learn from, as we grow -

we aim to help other project developers achieve their dreams easily and much quicker than we may have been able to.



This repository contains our contract available for all to view and in the name of transparency we will be listing all whitelisted wallets (project walets) -

here:

[] - DxSale Distribution Wallet

[] - Marketing Wallet

[] - Marketing Spend Wallet*

[] - Reserve Wallet**

[] - Extra (Backup Walet)



(no more than five wallets whitelisted at a time)



why five? one for each project wallet, one extra just in case.



Fee changes will be listed as well with the time and date the change occurred -

here:



(original)

4% Redistribution/Reflection

4% Liquidity

1% Marketing [0x0000...]

1% Burn

* We learned alot from the V1 of Armageddon instead of using the main marketing Wallet for interacting with DApps (pancakeswap) we will be siphoning -

from the larger Wallet to the empty marketing wallet in exact ammounts for Decentralized Application Connections to mitigate losses in an unfortunate -

event.



** The Reserve Wallet is for the future NFT launch we have plans for. (Reference "NFTs With Guaranteed Value" on the home page of -
